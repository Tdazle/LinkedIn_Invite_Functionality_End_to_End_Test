# LinkedIn_Invite_Functionality_End_to_End_Test
To achieve your goal of testing the invite functionality of LinkedIn, you can create an end-to-end test with the following sections:
1. Leading Profiles:
Read a list of profile links from an Excel or text file located in the project.
Alternatively, you can integrate an API that provides this list.
2. Login to LinkedIn:
Retrieve the LinkedIn email and password from environment variables (.env file) for secure
and automated login.
3. Visit Each Profile Page:
Implement a page navigation mechanism to visit each profile page.
Handle errors, such as profiles that are not found.
4. Connect to Profile:
Manage the connection process, considering that you may already be linked to some
profiles.
Add a customizable message to new connections, with the option to store the message in a
config file.
5. Generate a Report:
Create a report to track the results of the test.
The report can be in the form of a text file or CSV and should include the following
information:
The number of profiles processed successfully.
The number of profiles that failed during the process.
